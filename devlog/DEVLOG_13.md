There are a couple things I need to clean up before moving on to bigger things, like editing link descriptions and a viewer for the users of the website.

First, I need to be able to download the new graphs I make as JSON files. Second, I need to add... adding nodes. Currently, there's an option for it, but it doesn't do anything.

I did the first thing very easily with a keydown check and some link-creating;
