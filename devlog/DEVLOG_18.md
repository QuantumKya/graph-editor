## Devlog #18 - 9/23/2025
# Finishing Touches

This update mostly consists of little things that make the site better. Here's a list.

I...
- added color changes to the undo/redo buttons to show clickability.
- finished controls lists on both pages
- polished home page (added feature details)
- added shortcut for saving as image
- added node/link info viewer for graph viewing page!!!

Finished Home Page:

I think the site is fully finished now, and I'm satisfied with it. I learned a bunch while making it, and I hope people like it. :D
